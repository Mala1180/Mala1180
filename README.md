# About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering) at the University of Bologna ([UniBo](https://www.unibo.it/en/)).
I am deeply passionate about computer science, always driven by curiosity to explore new technologies and improve my skills.
My main interests lie in _Software Engineering_ and _Intelligent Systems_, and I'd like to become an experienced engineer in such fields.

In addition, I'm currently working as a Research Fellow at the University of Bologna, where I'm conducting research on the design methodology to ensure fairness in AI systems (fair-by-design).
